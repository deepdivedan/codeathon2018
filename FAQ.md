You may write in any language you want, but come prepared to explain your decisions to the judges. (see [Rules and Guidelines](rules-guidelines.md) for more information)

### When/Where can I hack? Do I have to only code at the event's location?
We have access to the STEMulus Center from 8:00am to 10:00pm on Saturday. Since the location is not 24/7, you can meet with your team on your own whenever you'd like. On location we will have plenty of space, a reliable wifi connection, opportunities to meet with a mentors to help architect your project, and food - breakfast, lunch and snacks. The more time spent on location the better opportunities to network and meet people in the community.

### What are the qualifications as junior, mid, and senior developer levels?
We ask that you self-assess. Mid and Senior level devs may be asked to lead a team.

For general guidelines, we say: 
- _Junior level_ developers should be prepared to follow team leads and be able to read and write code at a basic level.
- _Mid level_ developers should be prepared to breakdown complex problems and be able to offer multiple solutions.
- _Senior level_ developers should be prepared to lead a team of mid/junior level developers. 

### Can people from the same company/organization sign up for the same team?
Absolutely! We want you to have fun with your friends, so you can come with others in mind that you want to work with. Your team may be asked to take on another person depending on the amount and variety of ideas generated Opening Night, but it won't be required.(see [rules-guidelines.md] for more information)

### Can I be on a team by myself?
Sure! We encourage everyone to network and meet other developers but the rules are 1-4 people. 

### I have a MacBook/PC/Linux machine, will that be ok? What software programs would I need to participate?
The Code-a-Thon is platform-agnostic -- you and your team can decide what you'll use, and all you need is a computer with a code editor to participate, any operating system. More programs may be needed depending on how your team decides to tackle the challenge, but the Rules state that only tools that are free and openly available will be allowed. 

### When do I get my money?
"Dummy" giant checks will be awarded to winners on Sunday (just for fun and pictures), but the prize money payments may take 1-2 weeks after that to be processed. Winners will receive instructions on how to get their money after the awards ceremony.
