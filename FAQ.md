_Junior level_ developers should be prepared to follow team leads and be able to read and write code at a basic level.
_Mid level_ developers should be prepared to breakdown complex problems and be able to offer multiple solutions.
_Senior level_ developers should be prepared to lead a team of mid/junior level developers during the Code-A-Thon.
