# Tools and Datasets

## Purpose and usage
The following datasets and developer tools are encouraged for use during the Deep Dive Code-A-Thon. Public datasets at the city, state, and national level contain a variety of information ranging from environmental quality, crop data, transportation data, and more. These resources are suggested, but not required. In addition, feel free to use other open data sets and developer tools. Should you have questions about a particular resource (listed or not listed below), please speak with a Code-A-Thon organizer.
