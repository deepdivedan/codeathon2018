# Rules and Guidelines

## Purpose
To promote community amongst the growing tech scene in Albuquerque.

To meet fellow developers and work with them on a project, stretch our skills on quick prototypes or portfolio pieces, and share what we can do with like-minded developers.

## Schedule and Final Submission Deadline
A challenge theme on which to base your software will be announced Friday for Opening Night. Our sponsors will help us decide on a social or civic issue or problem to solve "for the greater good". After it's announced we’ll have some time to brainstorm, generate, and pitch ideas, then finalize teams around them.

Coding can begin on Friday, March 16th at 8:00pm MST. Your final commit must be submitted by Sunday, March 18th at 12:00pm MST. Committing code after noon on Sunday may disqualify your team.

## Winning
The winning prototype will be selected by a panel of judges and announced on Sunday after demonstrations. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd place teams will receive cash prizes.

- 1st place $2000
- 2nd place $1000
- 3rd place $500

These are awarded to the the winning team, not the individuals. If you are part of a 4 person team, you will split this amount 4 ways.

Each team will have an opportunity to show off their prototype with a quick ‘elevator pitch’ to all participants, and we will vote for the crowd favorite. Crowd favorite will win bonus bragging rights.

### Minimum Submission Requirements
A working software prototype is required in order to be eligible for a prize, including, but not limited to: web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps, IoT.

### Scoring Criteria
Teams will be judged on these five criteria. Judges will weigh the criteria equally. Teams must give an in-depth demonstration of the final submission to the judges. During the demo, participants should try to describe what they did for each criterion in their project.

- **Usability:** How easily can users complete their primary goals within the software ?

- **Architecture:** How efficiently is the code structured?

- **Security:** What security measures were taken?

- **Theme fit:** How well does the software work to solve the problem we are focused on?

- **Clean code:** Is the code easy for other programmers to understand, modify, and test?

These criteria will guide judges but ultimately judges are free to make decisions based on their gut feeling of which projects are the most impressive and most deserving, including taking into account the relative skill levels of participants between teams.

## Teams

Competing teams should be 1-4 humans -- no celestial beings, animals or exceptions. You are welcome to come with other humans in mind that you want to work with. If you do not have a team, there will be time Friday evening on Opening Night to meet other programmers and form a team.

## CODE
Our judges are proficient in [ languages ] and would love to see some awesome apps written in them. That being said, teams can choose to work in the languages they feel most comfortable and efficient in, and be prepared to explain their code to the judges.

Something you don't see here? message the organizers at (employers@deepdivecoding.com)[mailto:employers@deepdivecoding.com] and ask about it

## Open Source
The code repository must be easily accessed and monitored by judges. Put your code on GitHub. Because we like it that way.

## Intellectual Property
All submissions remain the intellectual property of those that developed it -- it belongs to team members, not Deep dive or any constituents, sponsors, or organizers. After the competition ends you may license or sell the resulting code, close-source the repository, or basically do anything you’d like.

By submitting an entry or accepting any prize, you warrant the following: you will not submit content that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the content; and the content submitted by you does not contain any viruses, Trojan horses, worms or other disabling devices or harmful code.

## Code of Conduct
Projects that violate the [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) are not allowed.

Teams or individuals can be disqualified from the competition at the organizers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to: breaking the Rules, breaking the Code of Conduct, or other unsporting behavior.

_Deep Dive Code-A-Thon Organizers and Judges reserve the right to update, edit, or otherwise make changes to this document as needed until Friday, March 16th._
