# Code of Conduct

## TL;DR.
Be respectful. Harassment and abuse will not be tolerated. If you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please report it immediately to one of the event organizers.

## Definitions
Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what youâ€™re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.

The Deep Dive Code a Thon will also strictly adhere to the policies and definitions laid out in the [CNM Student Code of Conduct](https://www.cnm.edu/depts/dean-of-students/student-code-of-conduct).

## Consequences
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Deep Dive Code-A-Thon may take any action deemed appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no eligibility for reimbursement or refund of any type. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an event representative.
